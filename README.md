# First-PyGame-Project
My first python PyGame project

# About me

Hello, I am Callum, I have been programming for a few years now. I first learnt lua then website development, to further my website development skills, I wanted to learn back end development, I heard that python was a great language to do that in, I fell in love with the language and now use it every day.

# Why PyGame

I am new to python game development, not so much game development as a hole, I started in game development then moved over the software/website development, As I said, I learned python and fell in love with it so I decided to put 2 loves into 1, game development and python. PyGame sounded, and is, a good python game tool, I only started learning it today and I can already see how good it is, the documention is easy to understand and easy to find what you need. PyGame is also very easy to use, it is not that different to vinila python, it can be a bit fustrating with 0, 0 being in the top left, but I will learn, for anyone wanting to start game development in python, PyGame is a good start.
